\section*{Description}
    An AI model that will take audio input from songs imported by the user. These files can be: .mp3, .mp4, .wav. etc.
    The model will process the input from the user and chart the song to the requested instrument by the user. The user
    should also have access to be able to set the difficulty that they want the song to be charted to. The model will only
    chart for one instrument at a time.
